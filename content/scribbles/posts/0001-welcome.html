Can technology be used in the architectural design process to further the goals of architecture? What parallels can be drawn between the IT and architecture industries? Can technology tools enhance the creative process, make it more powerful, more flexible, more efficient? Can architecture exist without technology? How can it coexist or even thrive along with the ever more rapid pace of technology development?

On a more practical level, how can architects use technology to multiply their ability to deliver great projects? How can modern tools be leveraged to more directly enable an architect to implement his or her vision? How can those tools be used to maximise the collaboration between the many members of a design and construction team, rather than hinder it with too much control?

Beyond architecture itself, how can the creative techniques of the architectural world be applied to other industries? How can techniques from other parts of the working world be adapted to construction projects? What are the parallels between software development, construction, writing, art, entrepreneurship, ...? How do those multiple viewpoints interact, and what can they gain from each other? If people are at the centre of everything, can all these centres superimpose and allow us to reach new perspectives from old ones?

We will try to answer some of these questions, and many others, over the coming months and years. We hope you will find the answers, and the journey towards those answers, interesting.
