Over the last two decades, information technology has been inexorably driving towards decentralisation. It is easier than ever to scatter a software development team across continents and yet allow it to collaborate effectively and successfully on a piece of software. The Firefox browser, which you may be using to read this article, is one of the best known examples of this. 

Until about ten years ago, however, few of those decentralised teams were businesses, but nowadays, even software businesses are beginning to decentralise completely. A small but extremely successful Chicago-based company called 37 Signals has largely been pioneering the model, by building a suite of business productivity tools that facilitate remote teamwork. EngineYard, one of the new wave of cloud computing providers, is another decentralised company. Woobius itself has no offices and is spread across two continents. Many more start-ups are following that path, and it is not unlikely that larger businesses might begin to adopt it, because decentralisation saves money and allows the work to go to the talent, rather than requiring the talent to move to where the work is.

Construction itself is immune to this development, because buildings have to be physically in a single place. But what about the activities of an architecture practice? The product of the architectural process is a design. It is an intellectual, virtual product that could be created from anywhere. Architects often create building designs to be built far away from their home offices, much like developers write software that will be used all around the world. And yet it is very rare for the architecture practice itself to be decentralised.

Why not?

Being able to collaborate from anywhere would present a number of advantages, not the least of which would be a reduction in costs, by not needing to rent expensive offices. However, for all but the smallest projects, it simply wouldn't work.

The reason for this is that the most important process that occurs during a large architectural project is the creative collaboration between the design team members. For any sizeable project, the greatest difficulty is in co-ordinating and enhancing this creative collaboration, to keep the team focused on the same goal (even as it shifts and changes with time), working together, exchanging ideas, driving towards a wholesome, coherent and convincing building design.

I believe the sole reason for this difficulty is the lack of suitable tools. There is currently no substitute for grabbing a piece of paper and sketching something for a colleague to ask for their opinion. No substitute for walking past someone's desk, glancing at their work, and, as an off-hand suggestion, providing the spark that sets the creative powder ablaze. Nor is there any substitute for spreading all the building drawings on a table or wall and wandering between them with your team and a few red marker pens.

But what if such tools were readily available? How might this transform the architectural world? I can't peer into the future and tell you how this transformation, which is quickly spreading from the software world to other kinds of businesses, will impact architecture, but I do believe that we will inevitably get there, and that it will be a big change with huge benefits, to both architects and everyone else.
