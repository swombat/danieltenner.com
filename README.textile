h3. What is this?

This is a blogging engine based on "Webby":http://webby.rubyforge.org/tutorial/. This repository contains all the files that are used to generate my blog, "http://danieltenner.com":http://danieltenner.com. 

h3. Can I use this stuff?

All code is open to use for whatever purpose you have in mind (though I'd prefer if you used it for a good purposes). You can copy the content and images too (though I'd really rather you didn't copy the content, or if you do copy some of it, please include a link to my blog). If you want to use the danieltenner.com look/CSS/etc as a basis for your look, that's fine too (though I'd appreciate it if you evolved it over time rather than keeping it looking exactly the same).

If you do find it useful, do let me know via github or using one of the numerous listed contact mechanisms on "my blog":http://danieltenner.com.

h3. Credits

The initial code for this was copied from "Rein Henrichs":http://reinh.com/. His version of the code is available on github too, "here":http://github.com/ReinH/reinh-com/tree/master. Please note that Rein is _not_ ok with you using his look'n'feel as a basis for your own blog.
